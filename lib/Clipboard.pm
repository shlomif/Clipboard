=head1 NAME

Clipboard - Copy and paste with any OS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Clipboard;
    print Clipboard->paste;
    Clipboard->copy('foo');
    # Same as copy on non-X / non-Xclip systems
    Clipboard->copy_to_all_selections('text_to_copy');


Clipboard->cut() is an alias for copy(). copy() is the preferred
method, because we're not really "cutting" anything.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Who doesn't remember the first time they learned to copy and paste, and
generated an exponentially growing text document?   Yes, that's right,
clipboards are magical.

With Clipboard.pm, this magic is now trivial to access,
in a cross-platform-consistent API, from your Perl code.

=head1 STATUS

Seems to be working well for Linux, OSX, *BSD, and Windows.  I use it
every day on Linux, so I think I've got most of the details hammered out
(X selections are kind of weird).  Please let me know if you encounter
any problems in your setup.
